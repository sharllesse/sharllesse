### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a personal project for fun and another project that will be on steam soon (I wish it come true 🙏) !
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ and C last year and not a big of it to be honest. But with C++ i was reborn !
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm only 17 years old and am already most of time coding and playing video games ! (More coding than the other one)
- 📖 I'm actually at Game Academy in France learning how to be a good programmer and to do money with video game (very important part 💀)
